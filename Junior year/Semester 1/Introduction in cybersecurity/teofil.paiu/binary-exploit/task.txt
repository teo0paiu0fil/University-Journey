# Casino

Hey there, fellow gambler,

Are you good with them numbers? If so, you can try your skills on our new
"AhleLele" virtual casino headquartered in Saint Tropez!

You will have plenty of fun and, if you are lucky enough, you win lots of
bitcoints!

You can also train locally using the attached program.

When you are ready to play the real game, the official casino is at the
following address (use a TCP network client to connect):
`isc2023.1337.cx:10003`.

Let's see if you have what it takes!


### Hints:

  - you don't have the source code :P #ghidra
  - try to use some tools on this one (e.g., python + expect / pwntools);
  - after succeeding locally, make sure to run your exploit on the server!
  - you can use netcat (`nc`) for opening a socket pipe with the server ;)
